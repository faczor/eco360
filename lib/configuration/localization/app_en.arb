  "symbol_facts_pet01": "\n ● PET was patented in 1941 by John Rex Whinfield, James Tennant Dickson, and the Calico Printers' Association in Manchester.\n ● The PET bottle was invented by Nathaniel C. Wyeth, an engineer at DuPont and the brother of American painter Andrew Wyeth. The patent was issued to Wyeth's company in 1973 and later transferred to DuPont.\n ● PET bottles and sunlight help millions of people in developing countries obtain drinking water. Using a system called SODIS (solar water disinfection), residents expose water-filled PET bottles to the sun for several hours or days – depending on the amount of available sunlight – as a simple yet effective way to destroy pathogenic bacteria and obtain safe drinking water.\n ● A single PET bottle (0.5 liters) is strong enough to hold 50 times its weight in water.\n ● A 2-liter PET bottle, which weighed 68 grams in 1980, now weighs only 42 grams. The average weight of a single-use 0.5-liter PET water bottle is currently 9.9 grams, nearly half of what it was in 2000.\n ● PET is the most commonly recycled plastic in the world.\n ● PET is used to make a popular filament for 3D printing.",
  "symbol_facts_hdpe02": "\n ● Polyethylene was first synthesized by the German chemist Hans von Pechman, who produced it in 1898 while heating diazomethane. Eugen Bamberger and Friedrich Tschimer examined the white, waxy substance and discovered that it consists of many -CH2- groups, naming it polymethylene.\n ● The material is resistant to mold, fungi, and rot, allowing it to maintain its shape for a long time without losing structural integrity, even in wet or humid environments.",
  "symbol_facts_pvc03": "\n ● PVC is one of the oldest synthetic materials with the longest history in industrial production.\n ● Researchers accidentally discovered PVC at least twice in the 19th century. The first discovery in 1838 was made by French physicist and chemist Henri Victor Regnault, and the second in 1872 by German Eugen Baumann. In both cases, the polymer appeared as a white solid in flasks with the newly discovered gaseous vinyl chloride, exposed to sunlight. The material was difficult to process, and no one could meet the challenges of commercial applications.\n ● In 1913, German inventor Friedrich Heinrich August Klatte patented PVC. His method involved polymerizing vinyl chloride using sunlight.\n ● PVC is the third most widely used synthetic plastic polymer in the world, right after polyethylene and polypropylene.\n ● In the 1950s and 1960s, the boom in the music industry paved the way for its earliest mass-market applications. To this day, you can find old vinyl records that are a testament to the durability of this resilient material.",
  "symbol_facts_ldpe04": "\n ● Polyethylene was first synthesized by the German chemist Hans von Pechman, who accidentally produced it in 1898 while heating diazomethane. His colleagues Eugen Bamberger and Friedrich Tschimer examined the white, waxy substance and discovered that it consists of many -CH2- groups, naming it polymethylene.\n ● Despite being a low-density material, LDPE is produced in a high-pressure process.\n ● Many purchased food products are found in containers that are almost always made from LDPE sheets. This is because LDPE is one of the few types of plastics considered safe for food, as it does not contain BPA (bisphenol A). Storing and consuming food from LDPE plastic containers is completely safe because the unique chemical composition of LDPE does not contain traces of BPA.\n ● The loose crystalline structure of LDPE makes this material very flexible and has the ability to return to its original shape after compression.",
  "symbol_facts_pp05": "\n ● Discovered in 1951 during an attempt to transform propylene into gasoline by J. Paul Hogan and Robert L. Banks of Phillips Petroleum Company.\n ● PP is a semi-crystalline polymer, meaning that the synthetic material exhibits organized and tightly packed molecular chains. Crystalline areas are called spherulites and can vary in shape and size, with amorphous areas occurring between crystalline regions. The degree of crystallinity affects many properties of the polymer. The semi-crystalline nature of PP gives this material a hazy appearance.\n ● PP has the lightest mass of all polymers and is also the polymer with the lowest density.\n ● Recycled PP is currently used in applications such as battery casings, paint cans, household storage, flower pots, composite wood, and furniture.\n ● Due to its lightweight, PP products generate less solid waste compared to other plastics.\n ● PP also has good temperature resistance, making it an excellent choice for applications in microwaves or for hot filling. This is due to the high melting temperature of PP – the working temperature range of PP reaches 146°C, and the heating temperature in a microwave and hot filling ranges from 100 to 120°C.",
  "symbol_facts_ps06": "\n ● It is often used in its foamed form - styrofoam. It is used for packaging protection, food packaging, and in construction.\\n ● Polystyrene was discovered accidentally by the German pharmacist Eduard Simon in 1839. From storax, the resin of the oriental sweetgum tree Liquidambar orientalis, he distilled an oily substance which he named styrol, although he did not know what he had discovered. It wasn't until 1922 that another German, chemist Hermann Staudinger, analyzed and described this substance.\\n ● In 1953, Hermann Staudinger received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research.\\n ● Styrofoam, a type of polystyrene, was developed by the Dow Chemical Company, also by accident. Dow employee Ray McIntire was trying to develop a flexible insulator by combining materials under pressure. As a result, he created Styrofoam, a material that expanded 40 times and was much lighter than regular polystyrene.",

  "glossary_description": "Polymer – a chemical substance consisting of many times repeated units called units. The basis of the monomeric unit (mer) is carbon (C). We distinguish:\n  ● natural polymers - naturally occurring in nature, such as: rubber, wood, proteins, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), starch, cellulose, collagen (skin component),\n● synthetic polymers (polymer materials) - produced in polymerization processes, which additionally contain auxiliary agents improving properties or processing possibilities. The most popular materials include: polyolefins, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate, polystyrene, polyamide.\n\nPolymerization - a method of obtaining synthetic polymers in a chemical reaction by combining smaller molecules (monomers - single units) into long chains.\n\nThermoplastics - also known as thermoplastics, belong to the group of plastomers. It is capable of repeatedly changing from solid to plastic and liquid and vice versa without significant changes in properties. They can be processed many times, i.e. recycled. There are semi-crystalline (hard and brittle) and amorphous (flexible) thermoplastics.\n\nDuroplasts – also known as hardenable plastics, belong to the group of plastomers. They transform irreversibly: under the influence of heat (thermosets), chemical factors (chemosets) or physical factors (elastomers - rubber, caoutchouc). They are infusible and insoluble. They are not recyclable, cannot be recycled, and are not degradable. For their disposal, the coking method is used (coke oven gas and coke are produced).\n\nElastomers – have the ability to reversibly deform under the influence of applied forces. These include both natural materials (natural rubber) and synthetic materials (rubber, silicone, synthetic rubber). Elastomers change shape under the action of compressive, shear and tension forces, and then return to their original shape and dimensions when these forces are removed. Due to their elasticity, they perfectly dampen vibrations and shocks and contribute to reducing the noise emitted by devices.\n\nDegradable plastics (including biodegradable) are natural and synthetic materials which, depending on aerobic or anaerobic processes, are completely decomposed by microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) into carbon dioxide, methane, water, biomass and inorganic materials.\n\nRecycling - is the process of reusing raw materials and materials, i.e. returning them to circulation. This process is complex and multi-stage and includes: waste collection and storage, waste identification, separation and sorting, shredding, washing and drying, and reprocessing. There are 4 types of recycling:\n● mechanical (also known as material) recycling, which produces a secondary raw material, i.e. granulate for repeated processing.\n● raw material recycling (also known as chemical recycling) involves recovering raw materials using chemical reactions, e.g. processing packaging into new plastic products.\n● organic recycling used for biodegradable waste, also called composting. This waste is broken down by microorganisms.\n● thermal (or energy) recycling, which involves obtaining energy from waste combustion.",
