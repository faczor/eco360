Wyeth, an engineer at DuPont and the brother of American painter Andrew Wyeth. The patent was issued to Wyeth\'s company in 1973 and later transferred to DuPont.\n ● PET bottles and sunlight help millions of people in developing countries obtain drinking water. Using a system called SODIS (solar water disinfection), residents expose water-filled PET bottles to the sun for several hours or days – depending on the amount of available sunlight – as a simple yet effective way to destroy pathogenic bacteria and obtain safe drinking water.\n ● A single PET bottle (0.5 liters) is strong enough to hold 50 times its weight in water.\n ● A 2-liter PET bottle, which weighed 68 grams in 1980, now weighs only 42 grams. The average weight of a single-use 0.5-liter PET water bottle is currently 9.9 grams, nearly half of what it was in 2000.\n ● PET is the most commonly recycled plastic in the world.\n ● PET is used to make a popular filament for 3D printing.';

  @override
  String get symbol_facts_pvc03 => '\n ● PVC is one of the oldest synthetic materials with the longest history in industrial production.\n ● Early researchers accidentally discovered PVC at least twice in the 19th century. The first discovery in 1838 was made by the French physicist and chemist Henri Victor Regnault, and the second in 1872 by the German Eugen Baumann. In both cases, the polymer appeared as a white solid in flasks containing the newly discovered gaseous vinyl chloride, which were exposed to sunlight. The material was difficult to work with and no one met the challenges of application commercial applications.\n ● In 1913, German inventor Friedrich Heinrich August Klatte patented PVC. His method involved the polymerization of vinyl chloride using sunlight.\n ● It is the third most commonly used synthetic polymer in the world - after polyethylene and polypropylene.\n ● From 1950s and 1960s, it is used to produce vinyl records.';

His colleagues Eugen Bamberger and Friedrich Tschimer examined the white, waxy substance and discovered that it consisted of it from many -CH2- groups and called it polymethylene.\n ● Although it is a low-density plastic, LDPE is produced in a high-pressure process.\n ● Many purchased food products are in containers, which are almost always made of LDPE. This is because LDPE is one of the few varieties of plastics considered safe for food because it does not contain BPA (also known as bisphenol A). Storing and consuming food from LDPE containers is completely safe because the unique chemical composition of LDPE does not contain traces BPA.\n ● The loose crystalline structure of LDPE makes the material very flexible and able to return to its original form after being compressed.';

  @override
  String get symbol_facts_pp05 => '\n ● It was discovered in 1951, while J. Paul Hogan and Robert L. Banks of the Phillips Petroleum Company were trying to convert propylene into gasoline.\n ● PP is a semi-crystalline polymer, which means that it exhibits an organized and tightly packed molecular chains. Areas of crystallinity are called spherulites and can vary in shape and size, with amorphous areas occurring between the crystalline areas. The degree of crystallinity affects many properties of the polymer. The semi-crystalline nature of PP gives the material a hazy appearance.\n ● PP has the lightest weight of all polymers and is also the lowest density polymer.\n ● Recycled PP is currently used in applications such as battery cases, paint cans, home storage, flower pots, composite wood and furniture.\n ● Thanks due to its light weight, PP products produce less solid waste compared to other plastics.\n ● PP also has good temperature resistance, making it an excellent choice for microwave or hot fill applications. This is due to the high melting point of PP - the maximum short-term use temperature of PP reaches 146°C, and the temperature of heating in a microwave oven and hot filling is from 100 to 120°C.';

  String get symbol_facts_ps06 => '\n ● Polystyrene was discovered accidentally by the German pharmacist Edward Simon in 1839. From storax, the resin of the oriental sugar tree Liquidambar orientalis, he distilled an oily substance which he called styrol, but he did not know what he had discovered. It was not until 1922 another German, chemist, Hermann Staudinger, tested and described this substance.\n ● In 1953, Hermann Staudinger received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research.\n ● Its foamed form is also often used - Styrofoam. It is used in packaging for product protection, as food packaging and in construction. \n ● Styrofoam was developed by the Dow Chemical Company, also by accident. Dow employee Ray McIntire tried to develop a flexible insulator by combining materials under pressure. As a result, he created Styrofoam, a material that expanded 40 times and was much lighter than ordinary polystyrene.';

  String get symbol_facts_pap20 => '\n ● The first use of cardboard packaging appeared in 1817 for transporting hats. \n ● A manual machine for corrugating textiles was used by Edward Allen and Edward Healey from 1856. They received the first patent in London for the use of corrugated paper. \n ● Albert Jones, an American, obtained a patent for using corrugated paper to protect fragile items in 1871. In the same year, G. Smyth built a machine for producing cardboard.\n ● Currently, cardboard is produced using materials such as wood fibers or waste paper.\n ● The machine used to produce corrugated cardboard is called a corrugator. \n ● Paper undergoes the corrugation process using rollers that create waves on the paper surface. The next step is gluing the layers at high temperature and pressure. Then the layers are pressed in rollers, and finally, the cardboard is cut into appropriate sheets.';

In 1955, the production of seven-layered cardboard began in the USA.\n ● Cardboard is the thickest (up to 4 mm) paper product with a grammage greater than 315 g/m². It is a much stiffer and more durable material than paperboard. Cardboard consists of several layers of pulp.\n ● Cardboard is a paper product characterized by uniform and elastic material with a grammage ranging from 160 g/m² to 315 g/m². It is very easy to process and is used for making boxes, book covers, postcards, packaging, or folders, suitable for printing.\n ● The first cardboard packaging was created in the workshop of the English inventor and industrialist, Sir Malcolm Thonhilla, in 1817.';

  String get symbol_facts_pap22 => '\n ● Paper was invented accidentally in China between 105 and 107 CE. \n ● Currently, paper is manufactured using cellulose fibers or wood pulp (shredded and ground wooden bales, usually pine). Other trees such as poplar, spruce, birch, fir, beech, or aspen are also used in production. Wood pulp is categorized as white (from spruce wood), brown (from pine wood), and chemical (from wood subjected to previous impregnation). \n ● Paper production also utilizes plant fibers (selected during the chemical pulping process) including cotton, linen, bamboo, hemp, reed, or straw, as well as waste paper.\n ● Contemporary paper consists of many non-fibrous substances such as organic fillers (potato starch) and inorganic fillers (talc, chalk, kaolin, or gypsum). Chemical substances such as hydrosulfite and dyes are also added to paper production, along with binding agents, coagulants, and waterproofing agents.\n ● Producing 1 ton of paper (200,000 sheets of A4) requires 17 trees (1 hectare of forest) and 1200 liters of water.\n ● Producing 1 sheet of A4 paper requires 10 liters of water.\n ● Paper consumption is steadily increasing, with global consumption at 55 kg per person annually, in Europe 147 kg per person annually, and in Poland 143 kg per person annually (Environmental Paper Network Report 2020). \n ● Remember! 1 tree provides oxygen for 10 people for 1 year.';

Elastomers change shape under the action of compressive, shear and tension forces, and then return to their original shape and dimensions when these forces are removed. Due to their elasticity, they perfectly dampen vibrations and shocks and contribute to reducing the noise emitted by devices.';

This process is complex and multi-stage and includes: waste collection and storage, waste identification, separation and sorting, shredding, washing and drying, and reprocessing. There are 4 types of recycling: \n● mechanical (or material) recycling, which produces a secondary raw material, i.e. granulate for repeated processing. \n● raw material recycling (also known as chemical recycling) involves recovering raw materials using chemical reactions, e.g. processing packaging into new plastic products. \n● organic recycling used for biodegradable waste, also called composting. This waste is broken down by microorganisms. \n● thermal (or energy) recycling, which involves obtaining energy from burning waste.';
